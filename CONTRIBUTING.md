## Thanks so much for your interest!

First, thanks for volunteering your time, work and skill into this project. You're helping more people deliver better R conferences around the world.

## Guidance

Because this project is gathering more contributors and more features (which is brilliant), we need to also consistently make the repo ready for 'production'. Therefore, we use a simple method of contributing pull requests into the `develop` branch. From there they will be merged into the main production branch.
